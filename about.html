        <p class = "aboutMain">
            I am currently a student at the University of Washington studying Informatics with a 
            concentration in Data Science and Software Development. I am interested in software 
            development and plan on pursuing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the 
            future. I hope to learn more about these fields through internships and courses. I am 
            currently pursing various opportunities through school clubs and other opportunities 
            to gain more exposure to software development.
            <br/>

            In my free time I like to teach myself various new coding languages and create projects
            that I find interesting. I am specifically intersted in projects that require creativity
            and exploration such as thinking of solutions to puzzles. I also like going to the gym, 
            watching documentaries, and playing games. In addition, I enjoy discovering new songs to 
            add to my playlist on spotify.
